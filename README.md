# Retail Forecast Project

Applied exponential smoothing methods and ARIMA modelling techniques to obtain a forecast on turnover in the recreational goods industry in NSW. Please visit the link [here](https://ishaan-gupta-au.github.io/retail-forecast/) to view the data analysis.  

Special thanks goes to Professor Rob Hyndman, author of the [Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https://otexts.com/fpp3/) textbook, from which I based the data analysis.
